<h1>From Veterinary Medicine to Software Development: Why I changed careers</h1>
<article>
  <p>
    Three years ago, I made the decision to accept a job offer, cementing my
    decision to change careers in my early 30s. At the time, I was working at a
    small animal veterinary hospital. My then new job was in software
    development, quite the career pivot. To this day the single most frequently
    asked question I get is
    <i>why?</i>
    This post will attempt to answer that question. This is, of course, just a
    personal reflection rather than a criticism of veterinary medicine.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>The Path to Veterinary Medicine</h3>
  <p>
    I, like many vets, became a veterinarian because I've loved animals ever
    since I was young. I started working at a local vet hospital in high school
    as an assistant. There I met a veterinary oncologist who also happened to
    work at the NIH doing comparative oncology research. Eventually, I landed
    myself a summer internship in his lab, assisting with his research. The idea
    of being able to help people or make breakthroughs in human medicine by
    studying animal models was intriguing to me and, as the introvert that I am,
    I enjoyed the bench work.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    During this time I was encouraged to pursue higher education by my mentor as
    well as my parents. This meant some flavor of graduate school (PhD) +/- vet
    school. In my last year of college I was offered a position in the lab at
    NIH as a postbac research fellow.

    . I had also applied and was accepted into vet school. While I wasn't
    entirely sure what I wanted to do for the rest of my life at the age of 18,
    working on cutting edge cancer research was a fascinating opportunity to me.
    Nevertheless, family pressure led me to accept the veterinary school offer,
    afraid I'd never go back to school and become a vet later if I didn't go
    then.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So, vet school it was. I graduated in 2017 and went on to complete two years
    of additional training (internships) thinking I wanted to pursue a residency
    in oncology, and ultimately follow in the footsteps of my mentor from NIH.
    Pretty quickly, I realized veterinary medicine as a whole was not a good fit
    for me. I abandoned the idea of a residency and started working as a general
    practice vet. I also started learning to code and began the long journey of
    changing careers and leaving behind full-time work as a vet. Below I'll
    attempt to answer the ever elusive question of
    <i>why?</i>
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>The Human Factor</h3>
  <p>
    I'm often asked by students if I would recommend becoming a veterinarian. I
    usually tell them "yes, if you really enjoy talking to people and also want
    to work with animals some." Of course, veterinarians interact with animals
    every day: physical exams, procedures, and surgery are part of the job; but
    those tasks didnâ€™t fulfill my love for animals the way people often assume
    they would. Veterinary medicine, I have found, is about 90% working with and
    managing people, and 10% working with animals (who are occasionally trying
    to bite your face off).
  </p>
  <p>
    Communication and education occur constantly with pet owners, understandably
    so, as our patients can't communicate or advocate for themselves. This means
    when you're working in a relatively busy animal hospital seeing 20-25
    appointments every day, you have 20-25 conversations with different people
    (in addition to internal discussions among staff, leadership, and others).
    These conversations can often be mentally and/or emotionally taxing: limited
    finances, optimal treatment options (for both the pet and the owner),
    euthanasia, etc... Managing expectations is also difficult: yes it's
    possible we might not find an answer even after running all the expensive
    tests. This is, unfortunately, how practicing medicine works sometimes.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>Lack of Personal Connection</h3>
  <p>
    Despite caring about every single patient I see and working with owners
    towards optimal outcomes, I never found the actual work itself to be
    mentally stimulating. Over the past nearly decade of practicing, I've found
    there is a big difference between loving animals and loving veterinary
    medicine. In light of that, I've accepted that passion can't be forced. I
    will of course always enjoy animals and practice the best medicine possible
    for each patient; but I don't think I'll ever find passion in veterinary
    medicine.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>The Operational Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout my time working as a veterinarian, whether full-time, part-time
    or relief, in corporate practices or private practice, staffing issues have
    been a constant problem. Being a veterinary technician is hard work, and
    unfortunately, unlike in human medicine where being a nurse requires a
    degree and returns a good salary, being a veterinary technician nets on
    average roughly $20-30/hr
    <a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a>
    .
    <br />
    It's no surprise then that long hours, physical and emotional stress, and
    low pay (among other things) frequently lead to burnout among veterinary
    technicians and assistants. This leads to frequent turnover, which results
    in many untrained or newly trained technicians and assistants. One of the
    results of this cycle is that both veterinarians and trained technicians are
    then left to compensate for others' gaps in knowledge/reliability (leading
    to more stress, long hours, etc...).
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>Personal Misalignment</h3>
  <p>
    Finally, it was my own personal preferences and personality which led me to
    leave the field. I enjoy quiet, focused work vs constant verbal
    communication and the often loud, hectic work environment of animal
    hospitals. I discovered (albeit 20 years late) that I could actually make a
    career out of my lifelong fascination with computers and technology. I found
    joy in creating and building things that people will use and solving complex
    problems. Perhaps most importantly, I've found that when I run into a
    problem in developing software, I'm excited at the opportunity to solve it,
    to learn, to improve. When the same happens in veterinary medicine, the
    experience often tends to be more stressful and anxious than exciting. This
    was important because with any career there will, of course, always be
    problems.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    While changing careers wasn't easy, I have no regrets about the path that
    led me here. Had I not become a veterinarian, I wouldn't have met my wife
    when we both worked at the same hospital years ago. My time in veterinary
    medicine also taught me about communication, working under pressure, and
    problem-solving - skills that have served me well in my current career. The
    goal of writing about my career change is not to discourage anyone from
    becoming a veterinarian. Rather, I'd encourage anyone who's unsure of their
    career to consider what truly energizes you and to pursue work that aligns
    with who you really are.

  I'm a veterinarian and software developer currently living in Northern
  Virginia. I graduated from veterinary school in 2017 and practiced as a small
  animal vet for 5-6 years before changing careers. Currently, I work full time
  as a software developer and occasionally work at as a veterinarian on
  weekends.

<h3>About This Site</h3>
<p>
  This website is written in Golang using mostly the standard library and a few
  small dependencies. It's self-hosted on a little
  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>
  that sits next to my laptop. It mainly consists of a simple http server, html
  templates using Go's built in templating library, and a little bit of css and
  js. Comments are stored in a postgres database, which is probably overkill,
  but was fun to build. The source code is viewable on my github at

<h3>Indie Web</h3>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a>
  consists of websites created, owned, and maintained by individuals. It's a
  somewhat niche alternative idea to the modern corporate web. One of the main
  principles of the indie web community, is having ownership over your own
  domain, website, and data. I've always been a fan of this concept of the 'web
  1.0', before it was over taken by a few large social media and advertising
  companies and was more of just a place to share information and cool things
  built by interesting people.

  This website is my small contribution to the indie web. I use it to share
  things I write about and projects I'm working on, as well as to share other
  websites I find interesting. If you're at all interested in building your own
  website, I encourage you to give it a shot. Building a website has never been
  more approachable than it is today. There are a million resources to get
  started, but this is one place to get
